# Transaction Frames

Frames can initiate transactions that apps that integrate Frames can complete, calling back your Frame.

An example snippet can be found below.

```tsx
    // ...
    buttons: [
      <Button action="tx" target="/txdata" post_url="/frames">
        Buy a unit
      </Button>
    ]
```

Use the [Transactions starter](https://github.com/framesjs/frames.js/tree/main/examples/framesjs-starter/app/examples/new-api-transaction) as a template to build your transaction Frames.

## Use the actual address executing the transaction

The Farcaster Client when calling back for the transaction data, will send the wallet address the user connected to the Frame Button with action="tx" set.

We can use this address which may differ from the connectedAddresses (Validations) the user has attached to his Farcaster Profile (FID).

```tsx
// ... in your POST handler serving the transaction data
const json = await re.json();
const frameMessage = await getFrameMessage(json);

if (!frameMessage) {
    throw new Error("No message");
}

const walletAddress = frameMessage.connectedAddress; // this is the address executing the requested transaction

// ...

```

Here `frameMessage.connectedAddress` is the address of the wallet connected by the user after pressing the button to do the transaction.

This is the wallet address the user executes the transaction with.
